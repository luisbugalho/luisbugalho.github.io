      - title: Hey! I'm Luís Bugalho and this is my webpage. I am a PhD Researcher in the area of Quantum Information, in between <a href='https://pqi.pt/pt/home'>PQI</a> in Lisboa and <a href='https://qi.lip6.fr'>LIP6</a> in Paris.
               I am originally a physicist, who found his way through mathematics, and most often than not, I enjoy solving problems as work. 
               When I’m not working, I’m happiest with an oceanic breeze, great company and good food. Welcome!

      - title: This is the webpage of Lu√≠s Bugalho. He is a PhD Researcher in the area of Quantum Information, dividing his time between <a href='https://pqi.pt/pt/home'>PQI</a> in Lisboa and <a href='https://qi.lip6.fr'>LIP6</a> in Paris.
               He is originally a physicist, who found his way through mathematics, and most often than not, enjoys solving problems as work. 
               This concludes the portion of the website where he writes about himself in the third person. Welcome!

I am currently doing research on quantum sensor networks. The main idea is to utilize quantum information bounds to figure out when and how we can best utilize quantum sensors in a distributed manner, to get the maximum information about a certain estimator. As it is known, entanglement is usually helpful when there is some non-locality of the estimator. I am currently trying to figure out a systematic way to analyze this problem.
